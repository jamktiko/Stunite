# Stunite - Ticorporate project

> Stunite is a Finnish website that helps users easily find event information and allows organizers to advertise their events. It offers a user-friendly calendar to view events and navigate to their details. Stunite serves two main user groups: event seekers and event organizers. Organizers have access to a special calendar view that includes upcoming events, provisional dates, and unpublished events. This feature helps prevent event scheduling conflicts by showing events in the same area or targeting similar audiences.
